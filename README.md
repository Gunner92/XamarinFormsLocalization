# Xamarin.Forms Localization Example
Simple example of how I implemented localization in a Xamarin.Forms app. With this approach, I am able to bind to items in a RESX Resource file dynamically. As soon as the user changes his preferred language in the app, the value of all bound resource items are instantly updated to the value of the chosen langue.

###### Remark 
Of course this sample is a bit of a naïve implementation as I just keep a CurrentLanguage field on the App class. This demo is just to show you how easy it is to implement localization of your app this way. If you want to do a 'full' implementation of localization, I would like to refer back to [this guide] (https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/advanced/localization/) on the Xamarin website and take a look at the ILocalize  interface and the implementations of it. Using that abstraction works great together with my solution of localization.
